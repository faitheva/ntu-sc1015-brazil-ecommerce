## 1) Problem Forumulation
<b>Problem Statement:</b> Analyze the customer behaviour and purchase patterns on the Brazilian E-commerce website to provide insights to improve the sales and marketing strategy.  
<b>Dataset:</b> <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce">Olist dataset from Kaggle</a>

## 2) Data Preparation and Cleaning
We prepared the datasets and cleaned them so that we can better analyze our data and allow us to use our data for the EDA and Machine Learning modeling later on. We performed the following: 
- Removed duplicated data and missing values
- Transformed the column into its appropriate data types
- Language translation
- Merging data from 8 datasets into 1

## 3)  Exploratory Data Analysis
In this section, we tried making sense of all the data that we had and drew relationships between the various data:
- Total spending per customer
- Customer orders from seller state
- Product category trades per month
- Customer purchase timeframe in hour
- Products sold per category
- Review score and delivery days

## 4) Machine Learning Models 
We chose the following 4 ML models to train, in alignment with our problem statement 
- Association Rule Mining
- Decision Tree
- Linear Regression
- Multi-variate Regression

## 5) Data Driven Insights and Recommendations 
We found insights and provided recommendations on the following areas: 
- Sales trends
- Payment methods
- Customer satisfaction
- Weekly promotions
- State sales
- Delivery time
- Product categories
- Review and ratings

## 6) What did we learn from this project?
- Deciphering data using different plots and charts for EDA (e.g Heatmaps)
- ML Models: Association Rule Mining, Decision Tree, and Logistic regression model training & evaluation
- How we might be able to improve e-commerce, and implement more rigorous and better strategies to improve e-commerce sector
